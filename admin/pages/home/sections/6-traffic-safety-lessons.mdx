We are the new authority when it comes to traffic safety lessons for primary schools. With our “Cycling diploma” we have an educational program where we use the bicycle to welcome the new generation to safe traffic participation.

Pikala roots from the Dutch cycling culture. In the Netherlands every kid needs to get a” Cycling diploma” at the age of 10. Research has shown that this gives them an advantage by learning and respecting more complex traffic rules at a later age.

Pikala now innovated the cycling diploma into the curriculum of the primary schools in Marrakech and Agadir.

We teach them how to cycle, how to respect traffic safety rules and about the health benefits of cycling for your body and the environment.
