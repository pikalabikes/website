Cantal Bakker learned the power of cycling while teaching refugees in the Netherlands how to cycle.
At the age of 24 she decided to move to Morocco to fight polluting scooters and cars with the mission
to make Marrakesh the cycling capital of Morocco.

Her family and friends said she was crazy, but several years later,
Pikala has become one of the biggest social projects in Marrakesh,
winning multiple prestigious awards and nominations from international organisations
such as the United Nations WTO, Smart City, and the Ben Salah Foundation.
