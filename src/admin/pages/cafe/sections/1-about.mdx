Pikala Cafe is not just a restaurant but a community hub with a mission to promote a healthy lifestyle through cycling. The cafe supports the Pikala Foundation, using its profits to fund social bicycle projects and advocate for a healthier Marrakech. By choosing to dine at Pikala, patrons contribute to initiatives that focus on youth development through cycling.

We offer a healthy menu with a Moroccan twist, including nourishing breakfast bowls, salads, and homemade fruit juices. The cafe is more than a dining space; it's a vibrant hub where tourists and locals converge, fostering connections and immersing everyone in the lively energy of Marrakech. The bicycle concept is symbolic of Pikala's dedication to promoting a healthier and happier lifestyle.
