“How to survive in the desert” is the theme of this bicycle tour. Guided by a local Moroccan tour guide you will cycle through palm trees and a desert-like landscape to discover the hidden beauties of “La Palmeraie”, an oasis close to Marrakech. Our guide will tell you about the history of La Palmeraie and how the Moroccans have been surviving there the last 1000 years. You will also learn some tricks on how to survive in the desert yourself!

During the tour we will make several stops at special places such as an old traditional Tadelakt factory, and the old water irrigation system used to bring water from the Atlas Mountains to La Palmeraie. Drinks and Moroccan snacks are also included.
