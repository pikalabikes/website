With our Dutch partners, we share key knowledge about urban bicycle infrastructure with local Moroccan authorities and policymakers.
We lobby and advise on improving bicycle infrastructure in urban areas of Morocco.

We have organised many network events where policy makers and city architects of Marrakesh
have participated in workshops with top experts in the field of bicycle infrastructure.
With our partners “GoudAppel Koffeng” and the municipalities of major Dutch cities, such as Amsterdam and Utrecht,
we provide a valuable knowledge exchange to make efficient bicycle infrastructure happen and thrive in Morocco.
