At Pikala we run social events, company outings and workshops, communication campaigns, and much more.
We offer many different cycling events for our range of partners to stimulate the use of bicycles.

We offer a free bicycle repairs scheme for those on a lower income during our yearly “Bicycle Atelier”.
This is to encourage safe cycling for all, use our funds to help those in need and improve access to cycling.
We also provide social activities around the relationship between environmental awareness and the use of bicycles.

Aside from our bicycle social events,
we have provided commercial communication campaigns
for big brands like Orange, DHL and Tui.
