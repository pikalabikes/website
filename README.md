# The Pikala Website

This repository works both as a Content Management System (CMS) and source code for the website.
Below is a guide for both administrators who wish to edit text + images on the website, and developers who modify the source code.

## For administrators

We use GitHub itself as a way to edit text and add images. All content on the website is organised as text files (`.mdx` file extension) and images (`.jpg` or `.png`) in the [admin](https://github.com/pikalabikes/website/tree/main/admin) folder. Here are the basic steps to edit content:

### Edit a text file

2.
