Through our Dutch partners, we share key knowledge about Urban bicycle infrastructure with the Local Moroccan authorities and policymakers. We lobby and advise in Bicycle infrastructure in the urban areas of Morocco.

Until now we have organised many network events where policy makers, and city architects of Marrakech could participate in workshops with the best experts in the field when it comes to Bicycle infrastructure. With our partners “GoudAppel Koffeng” but also the municipalities of major Dutch cities like Amsterdam and Utrecht, we provide valuable knowledge exchange to make efficient bicycle infrastructure happen in Morocco.
