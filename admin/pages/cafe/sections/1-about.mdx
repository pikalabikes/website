Through food and nutrition, Pikala Café exists to continue our mission to promote healthy lifestyles in Marrakech. The profits made from the Café support the Pikala Foundation by funding social bicycle projects across the city focussed on youth engagement and employment. By choosing to dine at Pikala, customers contribute to the development of these projects and support our mission in advocating for a healthier Marrakech.
