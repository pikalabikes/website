As bicycle guides, delivery riders, mechanics… Within Pikala we build multiple eco-friendly businesses
around the bicycle, employing the new generation of Moroccans in a sustainable way.
With this model the bicycle integrates within society and the profits made go to support our other social goals.

At Pikala, we don’t just provide employment. We deliver extensive training for all our positions,
from bicycle guides to managers and everything in between.
We also guide employees in developing of their professional career.
It is our focus to facilitate them in their growth as much as we can.
If employees show up late for work, they will not be fired - instead,
we search for the cause of the problem, and guide them to a more professional attitude,
from which they can benefit for the rest of their life.
Additionally, our work environment encourages employees to care for their society and the planet at large.
