Bicycles don’t pollute, are safer, take up less space, and don’t create sound pollution.
Scooters and cars do! Everything to combat the air pollution, and environmental issues of Morocco.

We focus on three layers of society. People (Bicycle Awareness),
Business (bicycle employment) and Governmental (bicycle infrastructure).
