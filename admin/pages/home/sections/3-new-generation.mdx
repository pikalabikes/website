Bicycle guides, Bicycle delivery, Bicycle mechanics… within Pikala we build multiple eco-friendly businesses around the bicycle to employ the new generation of Morocco in a sustainable way, integrating the bicycle within society. We use the profits to support our other social goals.

At Pikala we don’t just provide employment. We deliver extensive trainings for all our positions. From bicycle guides to managers, and everything in between. We also guide them in the development of their professional career. It is our focus to facilitate them in their growth, as much as we can. If employee’s show up late for work, they will not be fired, but we search for the cause of the problem, and guide them to a more professional attitude, from which benefit them for the rest of their live!

Apart from employment they will work in an environment where awareness for the world is an important topic.
