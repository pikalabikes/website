Our menu composition aims to create a dynamic and healthy alternative in Marrakech with a Moroccan twist. Offering homemade juices and our own herbal tea blends, varied vegetarian dishes and vegan options - our recipes' aim is to highlight and celebrate the health benefits of the ingredients we use. We focus on taste, seasonal produce and nutrition. Healthy for your mind and the environment!

We also have a coworking space in the Café and run weekly live music events. This takes the space beyond just a Café to a vibrant hub where tourists and locals meet, fostering connections and immersing everyone in the spirit of Marrakech.
