We provide free cycling lessons for girls and women.
In our safe course we teach them how to ride the bicycle
and experience the benefits of cycling, too.

Cycling is a male dominated activity in Morocco.
To support womenâ€™s empowerment we provide free, safe, private cycling lessons for girls and women.
We want to contribute to enabling them too with freedom of mobility,
and show that if you push yourself, you can do things that you never expected from yourself.
