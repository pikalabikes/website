Cycling is a male dominated activity in Morocco.
To support women’s empowerment, we provide free and safe cycling lessons for women and girls.
We want to contribute to enabling them with greater freedom of mobility and the opportunity
to try an activity traditionally pursued by boys and men.

Our “safe course” lessons start in a park so that girls can learn how to ride the bicycle
in a more sheltered environment away from traffic and crowds of people.
This helps to support their feelings of safety and promotes confidence
as they experience the benefits of cycling.
