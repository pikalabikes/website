We are now the new authority when it comes to traffic safety lessons for primary schools in Marrakesh.
Our “cycling diploma” scheme is an educational program which uses the bicycle
to welcome the new generation to safe traffic participation.

This aspect of Pikala has roots in Dutch cycling culture. In the Netherlands, every child needs to gain
a “cycling diploma” at the age of 10. Research has shown this gives children an advantage in their early development
by learning road navigation which helps them to respect traffic safety rules at a later age.

Pikala has introduced the “cycling diploma” into the curriculum
of primary schools in Marrakesh and Agadir. We teach pupils how to cycle,
how to respect traffic safety rules, and about the health benefits of cycling for the body and the environment.
